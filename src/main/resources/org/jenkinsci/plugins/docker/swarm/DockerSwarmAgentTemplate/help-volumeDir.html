        Option to enable a custom volume and mount to the specified folder. Similar to 'Cache dirs', except that you can choose here the volume name. Hence it will not be unique per job.
        This is interesting if you want to reuse information between multiple jobs or just to save disk space. One of the use cases can be as a repository cache.
